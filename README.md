### ðŸ‘‹ hi there, I'm Dylan!

##### I specialize in web and Discord devlopment but I have done many things in the past including Minecraft modifications and other small projects. In addition to development, I run my own roleplay server which you should totally check out over at https://concordstateroleplay.xyz, and I love video games.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Easy Bail Bonding](https://easybailbonding.com) and [Concord State Roleplay](https://concordstateroleplay.xyz).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++, C, C#, Java, and Python, but I'm always looking to expand my knowledge on [these languages](https://thedylanator.com/projects-langs).
- ðŸ“« I can be reached by email. You can email me at dylan@thedylanator.com
